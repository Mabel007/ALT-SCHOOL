            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Hi There! I am Christiana Mabel Nyuma, student at AltSchool who’s just embarked on the exciting journey of backend engineering. I'm currently learning the ropes and loving every challenge that comes with building and testing solid backend systems....</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Passions & Interests</h3>
            <p>I’m super into tech, especially coding, problem-solving, and figuring out how things work under the hood. I love diving deep into APIs, learning best practices, and growing my skills step by step.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Fun Fact/Personal Touch</h3>
            <p>I’m a bit of a mix: smart, flirty, and just a little shy. I’ve got a soft spot for deep convos and random bursts of affection. Also, I have a four-year-old nephew who keeps me humble and always entertained.</p>

            <h3>Why I Joined AltSchool</h3>
            <p>I joined AltSchool because I wanted more than just theory, I was craving real-world, hands-on experience in tech. I’ve always been drawn to the logic of code and the thrill of solving problems, but I knew I needed a structured path to grow and stay consistent. AltSchool offered exactly that — a clear curriculum, mentorship, and a community of learners all pushing forward together.</p>
            <p>Before this, I had moments of doubt and inconsistency. I knew I loved tech, but figuring it out on my own felt overwhelming at times. I wanted a space that would hold me accountable while also encouraging me to explore, fail, and grow.</p>
            <p>AltSchool feels like the right fit because it’s more than just lectures, it’s immersive, practical, and community-driven. I learn best when I’m applying knowledge, building things that actually work, and getting feedback from people on the same journey. That’s what AltSchool gives me, and that’s why I’m all in.</p>

            <h3>My Goals for the School of Engineering Program</h3>
            <p>In the short term, my focus is on building a solid foundation in web development. I want to master the core technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend fundamentals, and more importantly, apply them by building real, functional projects that solve problems.</p>
            <p>Long-term, my goal is to become a confident full-stack engineer, land a remote tech role, and eventually give back to the tech community by contributing to open-source projects. I want to be the kind of developer who not only writes clean, efficient code but also mentors others coming up the ladder.</p>
            <p>To stay accountable, I plan to set weekly learning goals, stay active in the AltSchool community, and document my progress, even the messy parts. I know consistency is key, so I’m showing up every day, learning from mistakes, and pushing myself a little further with each challenge.</p>
