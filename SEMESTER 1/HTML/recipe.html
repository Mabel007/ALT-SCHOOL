        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the top layer of the garden eggs and pepper that looks like stick. Do the same for the okra using a knife.</li>
            <li>Wash the pepper, garden eggs, and okra together, then put them in a pot with water. Boil for 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>After boiling, squeeze the water out of them and pound separately. While pounding, add Maggi cubes for taste.</li>
            <li>Rinse the pot, add fresh water, and bring it to a boil. Wash the rice and add it to the boiling water. Add a little salt and allow it to cook.</li>
            <li>Check after 2 minutes to see if the water is enough. If not, add hot water as needed. Allow the rice to steam until fully cooked and no water remains.</li>
            <li>Stir in butter into the rice for a rich taste.</li>
            <li>Season fish with salt and spices, then fry until golden brown. Fry shrimps until pink and slightly crisp. Optionally, fry sausage slices.</li>
            <li>Dish the cooked rice onto a plate. Add pounded garden eggs, pepper, and okra on the side. Serve with fried fish, shrimps, and sausage.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with benni (sesame seeds). Your Lafidi is now ready to eat!</li>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>
            For a richer taste, <u>use butter while the rice is still hot</u> so it melts evenly. 
            If you want extra heat, add more pepper when pounding. 
            You can also drizzle <em>palm oil</em> for an authentic Sierra Leonean flavor.
